AIMHII
=======================

This package provides software for identifying the genome insertion points random mutants generated by insertional mutagenesis, which have been sequenced as a pool.

The package will install two executables: aimhii and extract_chimeras.

aimhii will run a full analysis starting from sequence data (a FASTQ file), genome sequence, and insert sequence.  extract_chimeras just runs the last step of this analysis, assuming you already have a BAM file and a concatenated genome-insert sequence.

For details see the project website http://granek.bitbucket.org/projects/aimhii/

Changes since v0.5.1: Lowered pysam version requirement to allow installation using apt-get in Debian v8.
Changes since v0.5.0: Fixed problem with missing DESCRIPTION.rst.
