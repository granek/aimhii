This package provides software for identifying the genome insertion points random mutants generated by insertional mutagenesis, which have been sequenced as a pool.

The package will install two executables: aimhii and extract_chimeras.

aimhii will run a full analysis starting from sequence data (a FASTQ file), genome sequence, and insert sequence.  extract_chimeras just runs the last step of this analysis, assuming you already have a BAM file and a concatenated genome-insert sequence.
